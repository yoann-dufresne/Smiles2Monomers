## How to install (Command line procedure)

### Download
`git clone https://github.com/yoann-dufresne/Smiles2Monomers`  
`cd Smiles2Monomers`

### Compile
`ant compile`  
`ant create_jar`

Now you sould find a binary file named s2m.jar in the build directory. The program is ready.

## How to use s2m

### Using the ant file

#### Pre-computation
First of all you have to pre-compute all the monomers that you wish to use.  
For the pre-computation you need one json file containing all the monomers that you want to use and one json file containing the polymers that you want to use for the indexation process and the file containing the biding rules (see the research article for more details). The json files structures are [detailed in the wiki](https://github.com/yoann-dufresne/Smiles2Monomers/wiki/Json-formats). These json files are respectively named "data/monomers.json" and "data/learning.json". You can name your files in the same way or modify the properties in the beginning of the build.xml file.  
Then you just have to call:  
`ant preCompute`

To verify if everything is fine, go into the data directory and look for residues.json chains.json and serials/ directory. If they all exists, you can now run the program.

#### Running s2m
To run the s2m software, you need all the files used for the pre-computation (except the learning base) and all the files generated by the pre-computation. Last but not the least, you need the polymers json file. This file contains all the polymers that you want analyse. By default in the ant configuration, the file has to be in "data/polymers.json"

When all the files are ready you can tip  
`ant s2m`
